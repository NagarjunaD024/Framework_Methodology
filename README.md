# README: ISM and DEMATEL Analysis Notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:
1. **ISM.ipynb** - Implements Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM).
2. **DEMATEL.ipynb** - Implements Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL).

These notebooks analyze survey data to generate metrics and visualizations for factor analysis. Both methods are useful for understanding and modeling complex systems and relationships among factors.

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - jupyter

## Survey Data Input
- Factors
- Relationships

## Generated Metrics and Visualizations
- Tabular Metrics
- Graphical Representations



Install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
